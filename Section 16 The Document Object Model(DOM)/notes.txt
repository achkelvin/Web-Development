Add Javascript to a website with DOM
There are 3 ways to add Javascript to a website:
1. Inline Javascript
2. Internal Javascript
3. External Javascript

Inline Javascript
Inline Javascript is the Javascript code that is written inside the HTML file. It is not recommended to use this method because it is hard to maintain and debug.

Internal Javascript
Internal Javascript is the Javascript code that is written inside the <script> tag in the HTML file. It is not recommended to use this method because it is hard to maintain and debug.

External Javascript
External Javascript is the Javascript code that is written in a separate file with .js extension. It is recommended to use this method because it is easy to maintain and debug.
