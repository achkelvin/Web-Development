This notes is written following by exact timeline of the course Intro to Javascript

Have a Play around with the console in the browser
prompt = for input
alert = for pop up message
name.length = to find the length of the string
name.slice(0, 1) = to slice the string from 0 to 1
name.toUpperCase() = to convert the string to uppercase
name.toLowerCase() = to convert the string to lowercase

Data Types in Javascript
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean

Javascript Variables
1. var
2. let
3. const

Coding Challenge 1 Switch the values (var.js)
Conclusion of the answer is that we need one more var (c) to switch the values of the two variables a and b

Variable Naming Rules
1. Cannot start with a number
2. Cannot contain a space or hyphen (-)
3. Cannot use any of the javascript reserved keywords

String length and slicing
Coding Challenge 2 Twitter Char Counter (charCounter.js)
Conclusion of the answer is that we need to use the .length method to find the length of the string and then subtract it from 140 to find the remaining characters
Coding Challenge 3 Char limited by slice (charSlicing.js)
Conclusion of the answer is that we need to use the .slice method to slice the string from the start to the end
Coding Challange 4 Char Capitalized by Uppercase and lowercase combination (charCapitalized.js)
Conclusion of the answer is that we need to use the .toUpperCase method to convert the string to uppercase and then use the .slice method to slice the string from the start to the end

Aritmetic and Modulo Operators
Division (/)
Multiplication (*)
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Modulo (%) = Remainder of the division of two numbers (e.g. 5 % 2 = 1)
Coding Challenge 5 Dog to Human Age Converter (dogAge.js)
Conclusion of the answer is that we need to use the aritmetic operators to convert the dog age to human age

Increment and Decrement Operators
Increment (++)
Decrement (--)
